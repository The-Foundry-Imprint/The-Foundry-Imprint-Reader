REBELLION JUST BEGUN
ACT I: THE SPARK OF BETRAYAL
SCENE 1: THE THRONE OF ICE
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue (勤政殿), deep within the capital. It is an immense chamber paved with polished black marble, lined with pillars inlaid with gold leaf. Though the weather outside is warm, the atmosphere inside is frigid, dominated by the new King's cold, calculating presence.
AT RISE: King ZHAO Rui (趙睿), 25 years old and the eldest son of the late Emperor, sits upon the Dragon Throne. He is handsome but possessed of a chilling intensity. He has secured the succession, but his rule is precarious. Before him kneel three of his most trusted, yet easily controlled, officials: Minister WANG (Revenue), Censor ZHOU (Propagandist), and Grand Marshal GUO (Military Chief).
KING ZHAO RUI
(His voice is soft, a smooth blade of intent)
For two decades, since the passing of my mother, the people have looked to the border, not the capital. They do not whisper the name of the Emperor; they speak the name of the General. They speak of WEI Jian (衛堅).
MINISTER WANG
(Sweating slightly in his silk robes)
Your Majesty speaks the truth. General Wei Jian’s popularity is vast. The border provinces consider him their sovereign, not the capital. His virtue is a constant, unspoken criticism of the throne.
KING ZHAO RUI
Virtue is a liability when it outshines its master. But a mere execution would martyr him, cementing his legend. We require proof—irrefutable, political proof—that his kindness was merely a mask for treason. Have you prepared the evidence, Grand Marshal?
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
(A scarred, powerful man who betrayed his old colleague for position)
Yes, Your Majesty. For the last six months, we have diverted two years' worth of grain and tax revenue intended for the border forts into my personal reserve. We will plant falsified documents in General Wei Jian’s records showing that he embezzled the funds to finance a private army of "loyalists," intending to march on the capital during the recent Imperial transition. Minister Wang has signed off on the transfer manifests.
CENSOR ZHOU
(Nodding sharply)
The Censorate will begin the immediate dissemination of propaganda. We will frame him as the "Betrayer of the North," a serpent who bit the hand of the late Emperor. We will ensure the people see him as a hypocrite who starved his own border troops to fund his political greed.
KING ZHAO RUI
(A thin, predatory smile touches his lips)
Perfect. When the General arrives for the celebratory audit of the border defenses, the trap will close. I do not want hesitation. I do not want negotiation. I want the General's head and the complete dissolution of his legacy. The rebellion must be crushed before it is born. Go.
(The officials bow deeply and depart. Zhao Rui stands, moving to a window overlooking the vast, compliant city. He has eliminated the most honorable man in the kingdom to secure his own ruthless power.)
SCENE 2: THE GENERAL’S FATAL INSIGHT
SETTING: The General’s modest field headquarters in the Northern Marches. It is simple but meticulously organized, filled with campaign maps and dried herbs. A single candle illuminates the General’s writing desk.
AT RISE: General WEI Jian (衛堅), 45, sits alone. He possesses the quiet strength of a man who has held a border for half his life. His face is lined by sun and concern, but his eyes remain clear and kind. He holds a coded scroll stamped with the Royal Seal—the official summons for the "celebratory audit."
WEI JIAN (Internal Monologue, calm acceptance overriding fear)
Zhao Rui is not the man his father was. The late Emperor valued loyalty. Zhao Rui values only obedience. The audit... it is not a celebration. It is the end. He fears my history with his father; he fears the love of the Northern troops. He will not rest until my name is ash.
He remembers the death of his wife ten years prior—a slow fever contracted during a brutal northern winter. That loss had solidified his greatest fear: losing his only daughter.
WEI JIAN
(Whispering)
My sword protected the land, but it cannot protect you, my Ling Xuan.
He rises and moves quickly to a hidden compartment behind a map of the Western Plains. He removes a blank scroll and a small, worn piece of jade. He begins writing an urgent message in a complex, old military cipher—a cipher only one other man in the entire kingdom would recognize.
The message is addressed to his oldest, most trusted friend: HAN Tao (韓濤), the martial arts master and prodigy who abandoned court life decades ago.
WEI JIAN (His quill moving with desperate speed)
"Tao—The Dragon consumes its own. The pact is broken. Find Xuan and raise her under the ancient code. Do not let her seek the throne, but let her seek the truth. She must live. Forgive me, old friend."
He wraps the scroll around the piece of jade and turns to a young, loyal courier waiting in the shadows.
WEI JIAN
You 
must ride non-stop. Deliver this to the hermit Han Tao in the Whispering Bamboo Groves. Tell him nothing of its contents. Tell him only that the wind is turning north. Now, go. And may the gods speed you.
(Wei Jian watches the courier vanish into the night. His heart, heavy with fatalism, feels a brief, sharp pang of relief. He has secured his daughter’s survival. Now, he must prepare to face his fate in the capital, knowing the charges of treason waiting for him are fabricated lies.)

ACT II: THE FLIGHT OF SOARING JADE
SCENE 3: THE DAUGHTER'S DESPERATE ESCAPE
SETTING: A modest but well-maintained manor just outside the capital's fortified inner walls. This is the official residence of General Wei Jian's family, currently occupied only by his daughter. The night is quiet, thick with the silence before a storm.
AT RISE: LING Xuan (凌璇), 15, moves with an unusual grace for her age, a reflection of the subtle martial training her father provided. She is packing a small satchel when the frantic knock at the door breaks the stillness. It is the General's trusted courier, gasping for breath, the urgency of his mission etched on his face.
COURIER
(His voice a choked whisper)
Miss! The General... he sent a final message. He said the wind is turning north, and you must go now! They are already at the outer gate!
(The courier thrusts a small, heavy pouch into her hands. Inside is not gold, but the familiar, dark jade piece her father always carried, along with a crude map showing a remote bamboo grove.)
LING XUAN (Her heart pounding, instantly understanding the unspoken danger)
The capital has turned on him. King Zhao Rui... he is moving faster than Father predicted.
(Ling Xuan glances at the window. Distant sounds of Imperial Guards shouting orders are growing louder, closer. She cannot risk delaying.)
LING XUAN
(To the courier)
Thank you. Tell no one you saw me. Seek safety and await my return.
She does not waste time with tears. Her father had taught her to move with efficiency and precision. She straps on a pair of soft leather boots, dons a simple, dark traveling tunic, and exits the manor through a rear window, scaling the garden wall with practiced ease.
As she slips into the network of alleyways outside the walls, the main gate to the manor slams open, lights flooding the courtyard.
GRAND MARSHAL GUO'S VOICE (From the manor, sharp and furious)
She's gone! The daughter has fled! Find her! The King wants her apprehended immediately—alive, but silent!
(The shouts grow louder. Ling Xuan pours her focused qi into her legs, executing the rudimentary lightness skill her father taught her. She leaps over vegetable carts and vaults stone fences, driven by a raw, cold instinct for survival. Her mind is clear: the journey to the Whispering Bamboo Groves and the master Han Tao is her only chance to save the last piece of her father's legacy.)
SCENE 4: THE ARREST AND THE LATE EMPEROR'S FRIEND
SETTING: The vast, ceremonial square in front of the Imperial Palace. It is barely dawn, yet thousands of citizens have been ordered to gather. The atmosphere is heavy with fear and confusion.
AT RISE: General WEI Jian, clad in his worn military armor, stands defiant in the center of the square. He is flanked by two columns of Imperial Guards, led by Grand Marshal GUO. The officials, including Minister WANG and Censor ZHOU, stand on a raised platform, reading the public decree.
CENSOR ZHOU
(Reading from a scroll, his voice sanctimonious and loud)
"...By order of His Majesty, King Zhao Rui, General Wei Jian stands accused of the most heinous treason! He used the taxes meant to feed and protect the border to raise a private army, plotting to overthrow the benevolent Throne! He is deemed the Betrayer of the North!"
(A ripple of disbelief passes through the crowd. They know the General's face, his kindness, and his long history of selfless service alongside the late Emperor.)
WEI JIAN
(Projecting his voice with a final burst of qi, ignoring the guards who attempt to silence him)
I served my Emperor faithfully! I ask for no pardon! But I tell you now, citizens: this accusation is a fabrication! A lie created by a throne that fears virtue more than it fears war! King Zhao Rui sacrifices honor for power!
(Grand Marshal Guo signals the guards. They move quickly, roughly seizing the General.)
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
Silence the traitor! Justice is swift!
(The officials do not pause for a trial. The General is dragged toward the execution block. Just before he reaches it, his eyes catch the highest window of the palace—the one where the late Emperor used to watch the city. He closes his eyes, a silent prayer of relief escaping him: his daughter is safe. He has fulfilled his final, most important duty.)
(END OF ACT II)

ACT III: THE OATH OF THE SCARRED HEART
SCENE 5: THE HERMIT AND THE JADE PIECE
SETTING: The Whispering Bamboo Groves, hundreds of miles from the capital. This remote sanctuary is known only in whispered martial legends. The grove is dense, its silence broken only by the gentle clack of bamboo stalks rubbing together.
AT RISE: LING Xuan, now thin and ragged from weeks of desperate travel, collapses at the edge of the grove. She is exhausted, starving, and emotionally shattered. As she slips into unconsciousness, a figure emerges from the dense bamboo: HAN Tao (韓濤), the General’s old friend and a legendary martial prodigy. He is aged but utterly vital, his movements silent, his eyes holding the immense depth of his wisdom.
Han Tao kneels beside the collapsed girl. He finds the pouch clutched in her hand and unwraps the dark jade piece—the military token he and the General had shared since their youth. He recognizes the complex, old military cipher scrawled on the accompanying scroll.
HAN TAO (Reading the General's final message, his face etched with silent grief)
"...The Dragon consumes its own. The pact is broken. Find Xuan and raise her under the ancient code. Do not let her seek the throne, but let her seek the truth. She must live. Forgive me, old friend."
(Han Tao carefully closes the scroll. His grief over the General's fate turns instantly to a cold, powerful resolve.)
HAN TAO (Whispering to the unconscious girl)
You were destined for a peaceful life, Ling Xuan. Now, you are destined for war. Your father entrusted you to me, and I will honor his final, perilous wish.
SCENE 6: YEARS OF STEEL AND SILENCE
SETTING: The secluded training grounds within the Whispering Bamboo Groves. The scene shifts over a period of ten years.
AT RISE: (YEAR ONE) Ling Xuan is fiercely driven, yet untrained. She demands only one thing: to learn how to kill King Zhao Rui.
LING XUAN (Her voice hoarse with pain and fury)
I do not seek balance, Master! I seek vengeance! Teach me the quickest path to his heart!
HAN TAO (Calmly deflecting her frantic, wild strike with a single finger)
Vengeance is a shallow pond, Xuan. It will dry up and leave you stranded. Your father did not ask me to teach you murder; he asked me to teach you the truth. The truth requires discipline. You will begin by clearing the stones from the creek bed every morning, using only your breath.
(YEAR FIVE) Ling Xuan has grown into a young woman of intense focus. Her foundation is now immovable. Han Tao begins to teach her his own unique style, one that emphasizes precision, adaptability, and the integration of various martial philosophies—a necessary breadth for the complexity of the political battlefield ahead.
HAN TAO
The King's Guard will use brute force. The Third Prince's allies will use treachery. You must be fluid enough to strike through force and honest enough to deflect treachery. You do not just learn to fight; you learn to see the plot behind the strike.
(YEAR TEN) Ling Xuan (now 25) is a martial prodigy in her own right. She is lethal, graceful, and her emotional pain has tempered into cold, surgical purpose. She is ready.
HAN TAO (Watching her execute a complex, flawless form)
You are ready to leave the Grove. Your training here is complete. But remember this: Zhao Rui did not just kill your father; he created the most effective weapon against himself. You must not seek the throne, but the balance that will clear your father's name.
SCENE 7: THE OATH OF THE SCARRED HEART
SETTING: The General's old headquarters desk, now faithfully recreated in the Grove. Han Tao presents Ling Xuan with her father’s worn military sword—a symbol of his honor, not her revenge.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan takes the sword, the weight of its history settling on her.
LING XUAN (Sheathing the sword, her voice low and steady, a woman now in control of her immense grief)
I do not fight to rule, Master. I fight to erase the lie written in my father's blood. I fight to prove that Wei Jian was the kingdom's shield, not its serpent.
She takes the jade piece, which she has kept polished through all the years of training, and cuts her palm. She lets a drop of blood fall onto the map her father had used.
LING XUAN
This is not a simple assassination. This is a rebellion against the corruption that stole his name. I will seek out the truth of King Zhao Rui's power, and I will tear it down piece by painstaking piece, until my father's honor is restored.
HAN TAO
(Nodding, a proud, dangerous flicker in his eye)
Go. Seek the martial world. Gain the knowledge you lack, forge the alliances you need. I will wait here, and when you send the signal, the master plan will be executed.
(Ling Xuan turns and walks out of the Grove, leaving the world of training behind. Her new life—that of a fugitive seeking justice—has begun.)
(END OF ACT III)

ACT IV: THE MARTIAL ROAD
SCENE 8: THE LEGENDARY SENSING
SETTING: A remote, misty valley known as the Hidden Dragon Foothills, rumored to be a testing ground for young martial artists. The terrain is treacherous, crisscrossed by deep ravines and dense fog banks.
AT RISE: LING Xuan, traveling under a pseudonym and wearing neutral robes, navigates the shifting mists. She is testing her Master's final teachings on adaptability. Suddenly, a nearly invisible arrow, fletched with dark feather, streaks past her face, embedding itself with a deep thwack into the stone wall behind her. The arrow was aimed to warn, not to kill.
LING XUAN (Freezing, instantly recognizing the legendary skill)
Impossible precision. Only one with Spiritual Sensing of that caliber could place a shot in this fog.
JUN LI (君離, 25), the First Friend and her future lover, emerges from the heavy fog bank. He is tall, handsome, and carries a simple, massive longbow made of dark wood. His eyes are keen, betraying a depth of perception that surpasses normal sight.
JUN LI
You move like a ghost, traveler. You triggered my perimeter warning—a standard courtesy in these hills. Your internal qi is stable, yet your spirit carries the weight of a blood feud.
LING XUAN (Drawing her father's sword slightly)
My business is my own. And you, Archer, possess a skill spoken of only in whispers. Spiritual Sensing on this level—it should not exist.
JUN LI
(He smiles, a noble and easy expression)
I am called Jun Li. And sensing the world's intentions is my gift. I do not see the mist, I see the vibration of the air around it. And I sense great injustice clinging to you. Why travel the martial roads when your fight is clearly with the throne?
LING XUAN
(She lowers her sword, recognizing a genuine connection in his honesty)
My name is Xuan. My path is vengeance. And yours... why risk revealing a legendary skill in these hills?
JUN LI
Because injustice is a target that requires the longest shot, Xuan. I seek companions who aim true. I do not join fights; I join causes. I see no fault in your purpose.
(Their connection is immediate—a blending of her lethal, grounded force and his airy, supreme precision.)
SCENE 9: THE SWORD ADDICT'S CHALLENGE
SETTING: A bustling, chaotic Martial Arts Exchange in a major trading city. Swordsmiths, merchants, and low-level fighters mingle.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan and Jun Li, now traveling together, are examining an antique sword when a flash of silver cuts through the crowd. MEI Lin (梅琳, 23), the Second Friend, a woman whose eyes hold an almost manic, obsessive love for the blade, launches a challenge. She carries a variety of swords strapped to her back, but her current weapon is a wickedly thin rapier.
MEI LIN
Xuan! I have heard whispers of your sword form—a flawless blend of power and fluidity! You are a prodigy. And I, a Sword Addict, must know the limits of your skill!
LING XUAN (Smiling, a rare occurrence, recognizing the spirit in the challenge)
You fight without malice, only passion. Very well, Lin. Let me see the hunger in your steel!
(The duel is blindingly fast. Mei Lin's lightness skill is phenomenal, her rapier a constant, shimmering threat. Ling Xuan matches her speed with adaptability, her defense always flawless, never needing to resort to brutal force. The fight is a spectacle of speed and skill, attracting a large crowd.)
JUN LI (Watching, impressed)
She moves with no wasted energy. But Xuan moves with no wasted intention.
(After a flurry of thirty strikes, Ling Xuan disarms Mei Lin with a precise flick that sends the rapier spinning, but does not harm her.)
MEI LIN (Gasping, delighted)
Flawless! I must train with you! Tell me where you are going, and I will be there! I care little for politics, but I live for the perfection of martial art!
LING XUAN
We seek to clear a name stained by the throne. It is a long, dangerous journey.
MEI LIN
Danger makes the blade sing louder! Count me in!
(Mei Lin becomes the alliance's passionate, close-combat expert, her loyalty bought not by ideals, but by the pursuit of supreme skill.)
SCENE 10: THE TENDER TOUCH OF THE JADE FAN
SETTING: A lavish, if slightly seedy, Gambling House deep in the city. The air is thick with smoke and desperation.
AT RISE: MU Feng (牧風, 24), the Third Friend, sits calmly at a high-stakes table, winning effortlessly with a combination of uncanny luck and charming distraction. He is cute and tender, dressed in expensive silks, using a delicate jade fan as his only apparent accessory. Mei Lin, easily bored by gambling, watches Ling Xuan and Jun Li.
A burly enforcer accuses Mu Feng of cheating, lunging with a hidden dagger. The crowd parts instantly, expecting bloodshed.
MU FENG (Smiling gently, not moving from his seat)
My friend, you mistake skill for subterfuge. My apologies.
(Before the enforcer can strike, Mu Feng flicks his jade fan. It opens with an innocuous snap, but a hidden, razor-thin edge catches the enforcer's wrist, disarming him instantly and with surgical precision. The enforcer, realizing his mistake, stumbles back, intimidated by the sheer, contained lethality of the move.)
MU FENG
(Standing up, addressing the crowd with an apologetic bow)
I am Mu Feng. I hate injustice, but I love jade. And my fans.
MEI LIN (Her eyes alight, recognizing the weapon's potential)
Mu Feng! That weapon is beautiful! And perfectly fast!
MU FENG (Waving his fan toward the three companions)
You are clearly fighters of renown. Your intentions seem righteous. My skills—charming an official, navigating a hostile crowd, and my deadly fan—are at your disposal. I seek adventure, and frankly, I'm tired of winning coin.
(The three nod, accepting his unique blend of charm and contained deadliness. The two couples—Ling Xuan and Jun Li, and Mei Lin and Mu Feng—are now paired, the bonds of the rebellion already forming on a personal level.)
(END OF ACT IV)

ACT V: FORMING THE SEVEN
SCENE 11: THE KING'S COURT: STRENGTHENING THE CROWN
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue. Days after the fraudulent execution of General Wei Jian. The court assembly is in session. The atmosphere is tense—a blend of fear and ambition.
AT RISE: King ZHAO Rui (趙睿) presides, his authority unchallenged but brittle. Flanking the throne stand his two personal guards: FENG Lie (封烈), a brute force master with the Iron Palm, and XUE Ying (雪影), the silent, lethal assassin. At the side of the hall, the Third Prince, ZHAO Heng, stands slightly apart, a nervous ally of the King.
KING ZHAO RUI
(Addressing the assembly, his voice smooth and commanding)
The treason of Wei Jian is a scar upon our kingdom. But even as we purged that cancer, we must solidify the heart of our defense. Grand Marshal GUO, report on the Northern Marches.
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
The Marches are secure, Your Majesty. The narrative of General Wei Jian's Betrayal of the North has been widely disseminated by Censor ZHOU. We have installed new, loyal commanders and diverted the remaining loyalist qi masters into non-combat engineering corps.
MINISTER WANG
(The Minister of Revenue, puffing out his chest)
And the coffers are sound, Your Majesty. The seizure of the traitor's personal holdings has significantly subsidized the Crown's military budget. Any whispered dissent has been silenced.
THIRD PRINCE ZHAO HENG
(Stepping forward, seeking his brother's approval)
My brother is swift and wise. I have committed my two best guards, DONG Fang (Long Spear) and QIAN Yu (Fast-Strike), to assist in securing the eastern perimeter. We stand united against the darkness!
KING ZHAO RUI
(Nodding once, the coldness of his eyes contrasting with the approval in his voice)
Your loyalty is noted, brother. Let this assembly understand: The Crown is unyielding. Any support for the traitorous elements, or any association with my overly ambitious Second Brother, Zhao Yun, will be met with the full, devastating force of the Imperial Guard.
(The officials all bow deeply, their fear now firmly rooted in the King's absolute power. The scene shifts to the contrast of the opposing faction.)
SCENE 12: THE SECOND PRINCE'S CAREFUL AMBITION
SETTING: A quiet, heavily guarded compound far from the palace walls. This is the residence of Second Prince ZHAO Yun (趙昀). He is kind and thoughtful, but his eyes reflect the strategic depth necessary to survive the internal power struggle.
AT RISE: Zhao Yun is reviewing documents with his senior advisor, Advisor LIU, and his three loyal guards: SU Ming (Dual Swords), LIAN Hua (Whip), and CHEN Guang (Shield & Staff).
ZHAO YUN
The King's arrogance is his greatest weakness. He believes that eliminating Wei Jian solved his problem. Instead, he has turned a loyal subject into a martyr and created a vacuum.
ADVISOR LIU
The time is not yet right, Prince. We must continue to sow seeds of doubt, not outright rebellion. The Censorate's propaganda is powerful. We need a catalyst—a force outside our political circle, one the people will instinctively trust.
SU MING
(His head guard, alert and cautious)
My Prince, we must strengthen our personal guard. The King has the Assassin, Xue Ying. Our defensive posture is essential.
ZHAO YUN
(Looking at his guards, a genuine warmth in his gaze)
Your skills are peerless, my friends. But the fight is not won by defense alone. It will be won by information. We need eyes outside the walls, and a hand willing to strike without being traced back to this court.
(He glances toward a distant map of the Martial World, a faint, calculating smile on his lips. He knows the General's daughter is out there, and he knows her desire for revenge will be the perfect weapon.)
SCENE 13: THE STRATEGIST AND THE INTELLECT
SETTING: A hidden library housed within an old temple ruin outside a major city. The temple is quiet, filled with scrolls and ancient maps.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan and the three companions arrive, following rumors of a scholar known for unparalleled tactical brilliance and discretion. They find XI Shi (曦詩, 23), the Fourth Friend, meticulously charting troop movements on a giant map. She is sharp, focused, and armed with a subtle stealth dagger. Next to her, JIANG Po (江魄, 24), the Fifth Friend, is laughing hysterically at a passage in a historical text, a man whose intelligence far outstrips his poor martial skill.
LING XUAN (Approaching Xi Shi)
We seek the Strategist of the Whispering Sands. We are told you can plan a war using only a grain of rice.
XI SHI
(Without looking up)
I can. But rice is boring. Tell me your endgame. If your path ends only in the death of the King, I am not interested. Assassination is a tactic, not a strategy.
JUN LI
(Stepping forward, his spiritual sensing confirming her honesty)
Our endgame is to clear the name of General Wei Jian, exposing the King's corruption and restoring legitimacy to the throne.
XI SHI (Finally looking up, a spark of interest in her eyes)
Wei Jian. The General's name is a true flag. That is a cause. And who is your intelligence expert? Without flawless information, my strategy is useless.
JIANG PO (Looking up from his book, wiping a tear of laughter)
That would be me, the delightful Jiang Po! I am utterly incompetent at fighting, but I can read a coded financial ledger faster than Minister Wang can write one. And I have the wit to make a guardsman laugh while Xi Shi slits his communication line. We are a package deal, and she is my genius, beautiful love.
XI SHI (A rare, fond smile directed at Jiang Po)
He speaks the truth. My plans are complex, but his mind unravels the complications. If you want a plan that cannot fail, you take us both.
LING XUAN
(Looking at her six new, completely unique companions—her lover, the archer; the sword addict and the jade fan wielder; and the strategist and the intelligence expert)
The Seven Bonds are forged. The foundation of the rebellion is complete.
(END OF ACT V)

ACT VI: THE CLANDESTINE PACT
SCENE 14: THE MASTER'S SUMMONS
SETTING: A desolate, overgrown hunting lodge—a forgotten property of the General Wei Jian estate, just on the outskirts of the capital. It is heavily concealed by thick woods, making it an ideal staging point.
AT RISE: The Seven Bonds—Ling Xuan, Jun Li, Mei Lin, Mu Feng, Xi Shi, and Jiang Po—are assembled. Master Han Tao steps out of the shadows, having traveled swiftly to meet them.
HAN TAO
Your bond is strong, but the King's power is absolute. You are masters of the martial world; you know nothing of the political theater. King Zhao Rui must be attacked on two fronts: the open Imperial Court and the Shadowed Martial world.
LING XUAN
We understand, Master. We need a political figurehead—someone to legitimize the eventual coup and ensure the kingdom doesn't fall into chaos after Zhao Rui's defeat.
HAN TAO
Precisely. The man you seek is Second Prince Zhao Yun. He is kind, earning the loyalty of the Imperial Physicians and retired advisors, but he is shrewd enough to navigate his brother's tyranny. He is ambitious, but his ambition serves a broader vision of stability.
XI SHI
(The Strategist, examining a map of the city’s defense lines)
The risk is immense. Zhao Yun is closely watched. If the King suspects any alliance between his brother and a group of rogue martial artists, he will execute the Prince immediately, and our only political leverage is gone.
JUN LI
(His spiritual sensing focused intensely)
I sense Zhao Yun's compound. It is heavily defended, but the defense is static. It is designed to look impenetrable, not to react to a surgical strike. We can get in.
HAN TAO
The meeting is tonight. Ling Xuan, you must go with Jun Li. He is your shield, and his sensing will be your guide. Your father’s reputation and your skill must convince the Prince to risk his life for your cause.
SCENE 15: THE WHISPER IN THE GARRISON
SETTING: The heavily guarded residence of Second Prince ZHAO Yun. The meeting takes place in a quiet, secluded rear garden. The Prince's loyal guard, SU Ming (Dual Swords), stands watch, his focus absolute.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan and Jun Li emerge silently from the shadows, having bypassed all external defenses. Zhao Yun sits patiently with his trusted Advisor LIU.
ZHAO YUN (Standing immediately, a flicker of genuine respect in his eyes)
Only two people have ever bypassed Su Ming's security without alerting him: my father, the late Emperor, and now the two of you. You must be the General's daughter.
LING XUAN (Bowing formally, her voice composed)
I am Ling Xuan. And this is Jun Li. We are here not to seek asylum, but to offer a contract: your political authority for our martial force.
ZHAO YUN
The King has the entire Imperial Army and two of the kingdom's fiercest prodigies—Feng Lie and Xue Ying. What can seven individuals offer against that crushing force?
JUN LI
(Stepping forward, his spiritual sensing focused on the Prince)
We offer what the King lacks: Truth and Precision. The King operates on fear and deception, making his moves predictable. We offer a force that moves unseen, strikes with absolute precision, and is fueled not by coin, but by a righteous debt.
LING XUAN
Your Majesty, my father's execution was a lie orchestrated by Grand Marshal Guo and Minister Wang. I have documents—copies of the actual supply routes—that prove the embezzlement was done by the King's own officials to frame General Wei Jian. If you help us expose that truth, the people will see Zhao Rui as the real traitor.
(Ling Xuan presents a ciphered scroll. Zhao Yun takes it and rapidly decodes the contents. His expression shifts from cautious ambition to cold, furious certainty.)
ZHAO YUN
(Quietly, his voice filled with newfound purpose)
The proof. This is the truth I have searched for. My brother is not just cruel; he is a serpent who devours the good men of this land.
ADVISOR LIU
(Stepping forward, his wisdom clear)
Prince, the General's name is a torch. The people will rally behind it. Ling Xuan's martial force, combined with your political legitimacy, is the spark this rebellion needs.
ZHAO YUN
(He looks at Ling Xuan, extending his hand—not as a superior, but as a strategic partner)
The pact is forged. I will be your political shield, and you will be my sword of truth.
SCENE 16: THE PRICE OF THE THRONE
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue. King ZHAO Rui is meeting privately with his nervous ally, Third Prince ZHAO Heng.
AT RISE: Zhao Rui is deeply suspicious. He has sensed a shift in the capital's atmosphere.
KING ZHAO RUI
My spies tell me Zhao Yun is becoming bolder. He is meeting with Imperial Physician Zhang too frequently, and his guards are becoming unnecessarily aggressive in their patrols. He is planning something.
THIRD PRINCE ZHAO HENG
(Wringing his hands nervously)
Brother, my guard, QIAN Yu (Fast-Strike), is tracking Zhao Yun's treasury. We have found no evidence of an external military alliance. He is playing political games, nothing more.
KING ZHAO RUI
(His eyes fixed on his brother)
Political games are the breeding ground for rebellion, Heng. I want your two guards, DONG Fang (Long Spear) and QIAN Yu, to redouble their surveillance on Zhao Yun's household. If you miss a single movement, if you allow a single spark to ignite, I will not only strip you of your title, I will assume you are complicit. Do you understand the price of my trust?
ZHAO HENG
(Bowing deeply, fear driving his loyalty)
Perfectly, Brother. We will secure the city for the Crown.
(Zhao Heng leaves, his fear quickly turning to resentment. He is a pawn, not a partner, but his need for power keeps him bound to the cruel King.)
(END OF ACT VI)

ACT VII: MAPPING THE KING'S POWER
SCENE 17: THE WHISPER NETWORK
SETTING: The secluded manor of Imperial Physician ZHANG, a discreet loyalist of Second Prince Zhao Yun. The Physician's apothecary shop is a front for a critical intelligence hub.
AT RISE: XI Shi (The Strategist) and JIANG Po (The Intelligence Expert) are at a table covered with Imperial documents and cipher keys. Jiang Po is hunched over a thick ledger, occasionally chuckling.
JIANG PO
(Triumphantly)
Got him! Minister Wang (Revenue) is an absolute buffoon with numbers. He padded the Imperial Grain Transfer ledger not once, but three times this month. He's skimming enough off the top to fund a small army, confirming the corruption that framed General Wei Jian. More importantly, he's using the funds to pay Censor Zhou's propaganda writers.
XI SHI
(Marking a dense map of the capital with small, precise ink dots)
Good. Zhao Yun needs to expose the revenue structure before he attacks the military. We hit the purse first. But we need to know where the King's prodigies are stationed. Feng Lie (Iron Palm) is brute strength; he'll be near the main gate. The real danger is Xue Ying (Assassin).
JIANG PO
(Sighing dramatically)
The assassin. The ghost. If only I were a legendary Spiritual Sensor instead of just a handsome, witty intellectual.
XI SHI
(Looking at him fondly)
You are perfect as you are. Now, focus. I need the shift patterns of the guards protecting Grand Marshal Guo's private residence. We can use that window for reconnaissance.
SCENE 18: THE EYES OF SPIRITUAL SENSING
SETTING: The rooftops overlooking the Inner Palace walls, under the cloak of a moonless night.
AT RISE: JUN Li (Archer/Spiritual Sensor) is perched silently, bow unstrung but ready. Ling Xuan (The Heroine) waits beside him, relying entirely on his guidance.
LING XUAN
The silence is oppressive. Are we clear?
JUN LI
(His eyes narrowed, focused not on sight, but on the vibration of surrounding life forces)
We are clear, my love. But not empty. King Zhao Rui's assassin, Xue Ying, is always present, but his qi is the most suppressed I've ever felt. He moves like a thought, not a man. He is stationed near the King's personal study—a dedicated shadow.
LING XUAN
We must know the layout of the Royal Armory. My father always warned that the Crown's military might was concentrated in three specific weapons caches.
JUN LI
(Whispering, guiding her hand with precision toward a section of the wall)
I sense the armory beneath the West Tower. The qi of stored steel is deafening. But I also sense an anomaly. A second, hidden armory, smaller, but containing qi of immense power—perhaps ancient relics. It is located near the Third Prince's chambers.
LING XUAN
The Third Prince, Zhao Heng, is working too closely with the King. This hidden cache is his incentive. We target the third prince's supply line first. It will weaken the King's alliance and expose Zhao Heng as a pawn.
(They execute a silent descent onto the inner courtyard, moving toward the suspected location of the secret armory.)
SCENE 19: THE THREAT OF THE THIRD PRINCE
SETTING: A storage warehouse near the Third Prince's official residence.
AT RISE: MU Feng (Jade Fan) and MEI Lin (Sword Addict) are acting as a diversion, observing the warehouse.
MEI LIN
(Fidgeting, eager for action)
The waiting is awful! I could cut through the King's guards faster than Jiang Po can read a paragraph!
MU FENG
(Calmly polishing his jade fan)
My dearest Lin, my fan is for dancing; Xi Shi's strategy is for war. Our role is to identify who guards this cache.
Suddenly, two men emerge from the shadows: DONG Fang (Long Spear), the Third Prince's guard, and QIAN Yu (Fast-Strike), his financial/intel agent.
DONG FANG
(Wielding his spear with a practiced, lethal motion)
We sensed intruders. You are here for the Prince's private reserve.
MEI LIN
(Grinning wildly, drawing her rapier)
Finally, some fun! Mu Feng, let's see how fast this strike is!
(Mei Lin launches herself at Dong Fang, their weapons clashing in a beautiful, dangerous display of speed versus disciplined reach. Mu Feng does not engage directly. Instead, he uses his fan to create a distracting whirlwind of motion, forcing Qian Yu to focus on defense.)
MU FENG
(Charming even in combat)
My friend, you are too fast for your own good. Why not tell us about Minister Wang's involvement, and we can all go home?
(They manage to wound and disarm Qian Yu, proving their martial dominance and obtaining key information before melting back into the shadows. The skirmish confirms that the Third Prince is funding the King's power grab with his own resources.)
(END OF ACT VII)

ACT VIII: FIRST BLOOD: THE PRODIGY CLASH
SCENE 20: THE BAIT AND THE AMBUSH
SETTING: A desolate warehouse district near the Imperial Granary—a crucial economic choke point. Xi Shi (The Strategist) chose this location, knowing the King would move his assets here after the recent skirmish.
AT RISE: XI Shi and Jiang Po (Intelligence) are observing the Granary from a high vantage point. Mei Lin (Sword Addict) and Mu Feng (Jade Fan) are hiding in the shadows, ready to act as the primary striking force.
XI SHI
The King will send his best to secure the Granary after the warehouse raid. We need to demonstrate that his power is not absolute, but we cannot afford heavy casualties. Mu Feng, your charm and speed will draw out the brute. Mei Lin, your addiction for the sword will serve as the perfect distraction.
JIANG PO
According to the Censorate payroll ledgers I deciphered, Feng Lie (Iron Palm) is scheduled for rotation. He is brute force, predictable. The main threat, Xue Ying (Assassin), will be nearby, shadowing him.
MU FENG
(Flicking his jade fan open, a picture of calm confidence)
A brute and a shadow. A good challenge. Lin, let's make some noise!
(Mu Feng and Mei Lin move toward the Granary entrance, triggering an alarm designed by Xi Shi to lure the guards.)
SCENE 21: THE BRUTE FORCE TEST
SETTING: The entrance courtyard of the Imperial Granary.
AT RISE: Feng Lie (Iron Palm), a massive man whose hands look like slabs of granite, charges out to meet the noise. He is furious.
FENG LIE
You dare trespass on the King's bounty! My Iron Palm will break your bones and your sect's name!
MEI LIN
(Gleefully drawing her rapier)
Bones are boring! Show me the limits of your External Qi!
(Mei Lin attacks, not aiming to win, but to force Feng Lie to use his power. Her exceptional Lightness Skill allows her to dance around his devastating, ground-shattering blows. Mu Feng, meanwhile, uses his Jade Fan to strike at the brute's peripheral vision and weak points, annoying him and drawing his focus away from the true goal: surviving long enough for the tactical team to intervene.)
FENG LIE
(Roaring in frustration)
Stop moving, little insect!
MU FENG
(Dodging a blow that shatters a pillar)
Apologies, sir. My training emphasizes agility over static posturing. Perhaps you should try a little agility yourself?
(The tactic works. Feng Lie's fury and predictable, massive strikes create openings, exhausting him quickly against the speed and controlled lethality of the two friends.)
SCENE 22: THE SHADOW'S STRIKE
SETTING: A shadowy rooftop overlooking the courtyard.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan and Jun Li observe the exhausting duel. Jun Li's Spiritual Sensing is at its maximum, focused entirely on the surrounding darkness.
JUN LI (Whispering urgently to Ling Xuan)
He is here! Not on the roof, but in the walls! Xue Ying (Assassin)! His qi is like a black pit—he’s waiting for a kill zone!
(Xue Ying, moving through hidden ducts and shadows, launches his attack. He bypasses the exhausted Mei Lin and Mu Feng, aiming directly for the most valuable target: Ling Xuan.)
LING XUAN
(Instinctively drawing her sword, recognizing the shift in the air)
The King's true weapon!
(Xue Ying emerges, a blur of dark silk and cold steel, his poisoned dagger aimed for her throat. Ling Xuan meets the attack with the full force of her Master Han Tao's training—adaptability and precision.)
The duel is silent and terrifying—a clash between two martial prodigies trained in lethal arts. Ling Xuan's style is fluid, deflecting the dagger's precise, venomous attacks while never overextending.
JUN LI
(Sensing the immense danger, he sacrifices his cover. He draws his longbow and unleashes a barrage of arrows, not at Xue Ying, but at the exit points the assassin would normally use for escape.)
JUN LI
SPIRITUAL TRACE!
(The arrows don't hit the target, but they force Xue Ying to change his plan, revealing his position and momentarily disrupting his shadow form.)
LING XUAN
(Seizing the crucial opening created by Jun Li's selfless distraction)
Your shadows are broken!
(She executes a single, blindingly fast strike with her father's sword, aiming for the assassin's wrist. The blade strikes true, shattering the bones in his dagger hand. Xue Ying lets out a soundless gasp of pain—a prodigy defeated not by force, but by superior strategy and teamwork.)
XUE YING
(Staring at Ling Xuan with utter disbelief and hatred)
The General's line... I will return!
(The assassin vanishes into the night, nursing his broken hand. Feng Lie, seeing his elite partner defeated, breaks ranks and flees. The first major victory goes to the rebellion.)
(END OF ACT VIII)

ACT IX: THE BONDS SOLIDIFIED
SCENE 23: HEALING AND CONFESSION
SETTING: A hidden, secure medical chamber within Second Prince Zhao Yun's compound, overseen by Imperial Physician ZHANG. The air is thick with the scent of restorative herbs.
AT RISE: LING Xuan is tending to a bruised, but exhilarated, JUN Li. He took a glancing blow from Xue Ying's dagger during the ambush. Physician ZHANG has confirmed the poison was minor, but the danger was real.
LING XUAN
(Applying a cooling paste to his wound, her hand trembling slightly)
You risked too much, Jun Li. You broke your cover and sacrificed your legendary discretion to save me. Xue Ying could have killed you the moment you became visible.
JUN LI
(Taking her hand, his gaze intensely focused on her)
My Spiritual Sensing is perfect, Xuan. I know the true priority. The rebellion needs its sword, but I need you. The precision I seek in my archery is meaningless if the target is unworthy. Your cause, your truth—that is the only worthy target.
LING XUAN
(Letting go of her years of guarded vengeance, her eyes showing a rare vulnerability)
I have lived only for my father's memory and the fight. I did not allow myself to feel this connection. I realize now that clearing his name is not enough. I want a future with you, Li.
(He pulls her close, confirming their commitment. Their bond is no longer just martial; it is the emotional center of the entire movement—a future worth fighting for.)
SCENE 24: STRATEGY AND AFFECTION
SETTING: The same chamber, hours later. XI Shi (The Strategist) and JIANG Po (The Intelligence Expert) are reviewing the data recovered from the skirmish.
JIANG PO
(Holding up a fragmented piece of Feng Lie's armor, examining it with curiosity)
The King is doubling his defenses along the outer perimeter, compensating for the loss of his brute. He's pulling back Third Prince Zhao Heng's men, making the Prince look weak. Minister Wang is funneling emergency funds to hire new mercenaries.
XI SHI
(Her finger tracing a vulnerability in the capital's water system on a map)
Good. Zhao Rui's predictable, forceful response will be his undoing. We attack where he cannot send the military—his infrastructure. But we must be faster. The Third Prince's military guard, DONG Fang, is arrogant. We can exploit that.
JIANG PO
(Leaning over her shoulder, admiring her focus)
You are magnificent, my Shi. You see the solution in chaos. Your mind is the sharpest weapon in this entire kingdom.
XI SHI
(Looking back, a genuine warmth in her eyes)
My sharp mind relies on your hilarious genius, Po. Without your ability to make sense of the King's senseless ledgers, I would be blind. We are perfect because we are complete. Now, focus—we need a distraction in the financial district large enough to pull Grand Marshal Guo's entire attention away from the Prince's main political move.
(Their affection is rooted in mutual intellectual respect and collaboration, reinforcing the idea that the rebellion is built on competence, not just passion.)
SCENE 25: THE VOW OF THE PAIRED BLADES
SETTING: A quiet, enclosed training area within the compound. MEI Lin (Sword Addict) is meticulously cleaning her rapier. MU Feng (Jade Fan) is practicing a new, devastating short-range technique.
AT RISE: Mei Lin watches Mu Feng, a rare silence about her.
MEI LIN
The fight with the brute (Feng Lie) was exhilarating. But when Xue Ying struck, I saw the truth: our speed, while phenomenal, is useless if we are separated.
MU FENG
(Placing his jade fan on a stand)
Your blade is the point; my fan is the shield. My technique is designed to disarm and distract; yours is designed to finish. Our skills are not separate, Lin. They are two halves of the same circle.
MEI LIN
(Walking over to him, her hand reaching for his)
I fight for the perfection of the art. You fight for justice and adventure. But I realize now that the most perfect thing is standing right here, beside me. Let us vow not just to see this rebellion through, but to always fight side-by-side, no matter the enemy.
MU FENG
(His tender smile genuine and deep)
A vow of paired blades. Nothing would be more perfectly beautiful.
(They share a vow of unwavering loyalty and love, closing the chapter on their individual pursuits and cementing their place as the integrated strike force of the movement.)
(END OF ACT IX)

ACT X: THE PRINCE'S GAMBIT
SCENE 26: THE COURTESY CALL AND THE SEEDS OF DOUBT
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue. A day after Xue Ying's defeat. The court assembly is marked by a palpable tension and the conspicuous absence of the wounded royal guards.
AT RISE: King ZHAO Rui (Ruthless King) sits on the throne, his eyes burning with controlled fury. The Third Prince, ZHAO Heng, stands beside him, nervous but attempting to look supportive. Grand Marshal GUO (Military Chief) shifts uncomfortably.
SECOND PRINCE ZHAO YUN (Strategic Prince) enters, impeccably dressed, radiating concern and genuine sympathy—a masterpiece of political theater. He is flanked by his own loyal guards, SU Ming (Dual Swords) and LIAN Hua (Whip).
ZHAO YUN
(Bowing deeply, his voice carrying just the right amount of sorrow)
Brother, I am deeply troubled. The attacks on the Granary and the assault on the Imperial Guards—these are not the acts of mere bandits. They are surgically precise, professional strikes. I fear your enemy is far more organized than you believe.
KING ZHAO RUI
(His soft voice laced with venom)
My enemies are the traitor Wei Jian's lingering loyalists, nothing more. We will crush them.
ZHAO YUN
Perhaps. But consider this, Brother. The enemies were only able to escape because they were prepared for Grand Marshal Guo's predictable, massive counter-attack. A true enemy uses deception and intelligence, not brute force. I have asked Advisor LIU to analyze the weaknesses in our city defenses, looking for unconventional vulnerabilities.
(Zhao Yun has skillfully introduced the idea that the King's own leadership is the vulnerability, not just the enemy. He has subtly cast doubt on the King's closest military ally, Grand Marshal Guo.)
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
(Flushing with outrage at the implied criticism)
My Prince, my strategy is built on overwhelming might!
ZHAO YUN
(Turning to the Grand Marshal with a courteous smile)
As it should be, Grand Marshal. But overwhelming might is wasted if the enemy knows exactly where it will fall.
(The King stares intently at Zhao Yun, unable to fault his loyalty or his logic, but knowing this public critique is a deliberate political maneuver.)
SCENE 27: THE PLOT OF THE PADDED LEDGER
SETTING: The office of Minister WANG (Revenue). It is late at night. The Minister is panicking, nervously shuffling coded ledgers.
AT RISE: Minister Wang is startled by a quiet knock. It is Censor ZHOU (Propagandist), looking grim.
CENSOR ZHOU
Minister, there are unsettling whispers in the Censorate. Second Prince Zhao Yun is asking pointed questions about the Northern Marches revenue transfer—the one that framed General Wei Jian.
MINISTER WANG
(Wiping sweat from his brow)
Impossible! The ledgers are perfect! I personally signed the transfer order authorizing the seizure of "traitor funds."
CENSOR ZHOU
The Prince is not questioning the seizure; he is questioning the amount. He suggests the discrepancy between the amount reported to the King and the amount actually seized is too large. He believes you—not the King—are skimming the difference and using it to bribe officials to support the King.
(Censor Zhou has deliberately planted a false suspicion—a move orchestrated by Advisor Liu and Jiang Po's intelligence—to drive a wedge between the King's officials.)
MINISTER WANG
(Gasping in fear)
But the King trusts me! The King knows I am loyal!
CENSOR ZHOU
(Leaning in, playing the concerned ally)
The King trusts only results, Minister. You need to prove your loyalty. Find out what Prince Zhao Yun knows. If you don't, Zhao Rui will assume the Prince's accusations are true and execute you for the embezzlement you didn't commit.
(Minister Wang, terrified of being seen as a liability by the ruthless King, resolves to find the source of the leak, unwittingly leading him directly into the Seven Bonds' next trap.)
SCENE 28: THE THIRD PRINCE'S FRUSTRATION
SETTING: The private library of Third Prince ZHAO Heng.
AT RISE: Zhao Heng is pacing furiously. His two guards, DONG Fang (Long Spear) and QIAN Yu (Fast-Strike), stand silently. The Third Prince has been publicly marginalized.
ZHAO HENG
The King has ordered my troops to retreat from the perimeter, claiming my guard, Dong Fang, is needed for "internal drills"! He treats me like a child! He trusts the brute, Feng Lie, more than his own brother!
DONG FANG
Your Highness, the King fears the loss of his guards. He needs to conserve his own personal power.
ZHAO HENG
And the Second Prince makes me look like a fool in the court! He speaks of strategy and competence while I am relegated to a glorified sentry! We need to prove our worth to Zhao Rui. We need to find this rebel group ourselves and deliver their heads to the King.
QIAN YU
(The Intelligence guard, stepping forward cautiously)
I have traced the recent martial activity to the general district where the old General's properties were seized. The rebels are moving the General's assets, using them as currency. If we hit the final, largest safe house before they can liquidate the asset, we can expose the entire operation and seize the King's favor.
ZHAO HENG
(His eyes alight with desperate ambition)
Do it! Find this rebel leader! We will not be sidelined by the Second Prince!
(The Third Prince, desperate for his brother's approval, has now committed his own forces to fighting the rebellion directly, exactly where Xi Shi wanted them—away from the King's centralized defenses.)
(END OF ACT X)

ACT XI: THE CENSORATE'S FURY
SCENE 29: THE PURGE OF THE LOYALISTS
SETTING: The Imperial Censorate Headquarters. Day time. A cold, busy administrative setting where the kingdom's information and propaganda are controlled.
AT RISE: Censor ZHOU (Propagandist), acting on the direct orders of the King, is overseeing a rapid, merciless purge of officials suspected of sympathy toward the Second Prince, Zhao Yun, or those who served General Wei Jian.
CENSOR ZHOU
(Slamming a list onto a clerk's desk)
The King will not tolerate wavering loyalty! Imperial Physician ZHANG has been deemed a threat due to his "unauthorized acquisition of rare herbs"—a clear code for treasonous communication! Seize his properties! Detain the retired Advisor LIU! His political counsel is now deemed subversive!
(The efficiency of the Censorate is terrifying. Within hours, Zhao Yun's network of information and wisdom—essential for the post-rebellion stability—is being dismantled.)
CENSOR ZHOU
(To a young subordinate)
We must also find the source of the rumors about Minister WANG's embezzlement. The King may forgive treason, but he will not forgive financial incompetence! Find the intelligence leak!
(The sudden, aggressive purge proves that the alliance's small skirmishes have had a large, unintended consequence: accelerating the King's tyranny and forcing Zhao Yun's hand.)
SCENE 30: THE WARNING AND THE ACCELERATION
SETTING: Second Prince Zhao Yun's secure compound. The Prince's loyal guard, SU Ming (Dual Swords), is on edge, anticipating an attack.
AT RISE: ZHAO YUN is meeting with Ling Xuan and Xi Shi (The Strategist). The news of the purge is grim.
ZHAO YUN
My network is collapsing. The Censorate's swiftness is frightening. Advisor Liu is in custody. Physician Zhang is in hiding, but his medicinal stores—our primary supply of healing and antidote—have been seized. We have lost our political counsel and our vital support in the city.
LING XUAN
(Her face set with grim determination)
The King's ruthlessness has removed our window for careful planning. We cannot wait for the perfect timing. If we lose you, Prince, the rebellion becomes mere banditry. We must move now.
XI SHI
(Her eyes intensely focused on the map, adapting instantly)
The King has made a critical strategic error. By focusing on his political rivals (Zhao Yun's officials), he has momentarily left his financial pillar exposed. Minister Wang, terrified of being exposed as an embezzler, is now trying to move his ill-gotten gains. This is our moment.
LING XUAN
The plan must be accelerated. We hit the assets.
SCENE 31: THE STRATEGIC DIVERSION AND THE JADE FAN
SETTING: The busiest financial district of the capital, near the main Imperial Treasury building. Night.
AT RISE: XI Shi's accelerated plan is in motion. The goal is to create a massive diversion and cripple the financial pillar of the King's power, forcing Grand Marshal Guo (Military) to commit his remaining forces.
JIANG PO (Intelligence) has identified a specific warehouse where Minister Wang is moving a massive amount of illegal silver and records.
MU FENG (Jade Fan) and MEI Lin (Sword Addict) are the infiltration team. Mu Feng's skill with the fan—used to cut wires and confuse security—is essential.
MU FENG
(Whispering to Mei Lin)
The scent of freshly minted silver is overwhelming. Our mission is to secure the ledger, not the silver. And avoid breaking the Third Prince's watchmen—they are too eager for a fight.
(They breach the warehouse. Mu Feng uses his Jade Fan to slice the oil lamps and the building's alarm wires, plunging the space into darkness. Mei Lin moves to neutralize the armed guards with non-lethal, precise strikes.)
MEI LIN
(Her voice a low, excited whisper)
The fight with the shadows is exhilarating!
(They find the massive silver cache and, more importantly, Minister Wang's personal, secret ledger. As they retreat, they leave behind a single, perfectly placed military token belonging to Grand Marshal Guo's own command.)
XI SHI'S VOICE (From a hidden communicator device)
Exit now! The fire is set!
(The nearby warehouses, pre-rigged by Xi Shi's planning, erupt into non-critical, controlled fires. The alarm sounds throughout the financial district.)
JIANG PO'S VOICE
(Over the communicator, with a chuckle)
The ledger is now secured. And Minister Wang just realized that Grand Marshal Guo stole his secret silver. Chaos initiated!
(The chaos of the financial district on fire, coupled with the planted evidence, ensures that King Zhao Rui's most crucial officials—Revenue and Military—will now be distracted by internal accusations of double-crossing.)
(END OF ACT XI)

ACT XII: THE TREACHEROUS BROTHER
SCENE 32: A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR FAVOR
SETTING: A secondary command center near the military barracks. Day time. Grand Marshal Guo is dealing with the financial district fires and the internal accusations leveled against him by Minister Wang.
AT RISE: Third Prince ZHAO Heng (The Nervous Ally) storms into the command center, ignoring the chaos. He is desperate to regain favor after being sidelined by his older brother, the King. He is accompanied by his two ambitious guards, DONG Fang (Long Spear) and QIAN Yu (Fast-Strike).
ZHAO HENG
(To Grand Marshal Guo, his voice high with agitation)
While you manage fires and petty financial squabbles, the true threat continues to mock the Crown! I have information! We have tracked the rebels to a secure location near the old General's estate—a place where they are moving the last of Wei Jian's assets!
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
(Distracted and furious about the embezzlement rumors)
The King has ordered me to secure the treasury! I have no time for rogue assassins, Prince!
ZHAO HENG
(Pleading, seizing his opportunity)
Then allow me to handle it! I will crush this group and present their leader to my brother! This will prove my absolute loyalty, and you, Marshal, will be commended for allowing me to utilize my resources efficiently!
DONG FANG
(Stepping forward, seeking glory)
We know their location, Marshal. We will use the Prince's private guards to secure the asset and eliminate the threat.
(Grand Marshal Guo, seeing an easy way to satisfy the Third Prince and remove a distraction without committing his own precious main forces, reluctantly agrees.)
GRAND MARSHAL GUO
Very well. Bring me their heads. Do not fail, Prince.
SCENE 33: THE AMBUSH OF THE PREDATOR
SETTING: The General's old, isolated supply depot—the final "asset" location. Night. The Seven Bonds are moving the last of General Wei Jian's personal correspondence and strategic maps.
AT RISE: XI Shi (The Strategist) stands with Jun Li (Spiritual Sensor). They know the Third Prince is coming—they placed the bait perfectly.
XI SHI
Zhao Heng's impatience makes him a useful idiot. He believes he is hunting us, but we are waiting for him. Our goal is not to kill him, but to discredit his loyalty to the King.
JUN LI
(His sensing alert)
Three targets approaching fast. The Prince is not with them. Just his two guards, Dong Fang and Qian Yu, and a small contingent of his private force. They are eager for a fight.
LING XUAN
(Stepping forward with her father's sword)
We strike with overwhelming force and speed. We break their spirit, then we ensure they report back to the King exactly what Zhao Yun wants them to report.
(The Seven Bonds launch a devastating ambush. The two pairs—Mei Lin/Mu Feng and Xi Shi/Jiang Po—cut off the retreat and communication lines. Jun Li uses his Spiritual Sensing to guide Ling Xuan's lightning-fast attacks.)
LING XUAN (Confronting Dong Fang)
You serve a tyrant and fight for ambition! My father died for honor!
(The fight is short and sharp. Dong Fang's powerful Long Spear is countered by Ling Xuan's fluid adaptability, while Qian Yu's Fast-Strike proves useless against the coordinated effort of the Seven. The Prince's force is utterly defeated.)
SCENE 34: THE WHISPER OF TREACHERY
SETTING: The aftermath of the skirmish. Dong Fang and Qian Yu are disarmed, wounded, and terrified.
AT RISE: Ling Xuan stands over the defeated guards. She does not kill them. Xi Shi steps forward.
XI SHI
(Her voice cool and authoritative)
You will return to Third Prince Zhao Heng. You will tell him that the rebels—the "Wei Jian Loyalists"—knew your exact plan, your routes, and your timing. You will tell him that the only way the rebels could have known was through a direct leak from the Imperial Palace.
DONG FANG (Confused and afraid)
But who?
XI SHI
(Leaning in, planting the final seed of doubt)
Tell him it could only be the man who wants the throne the most: King Zhao Rui. Tell your Prince that his own brother betrayed his trust to sabotage his attempt at glory. Tell him the King sees him as a threat, not an ally.
(The guards, desperate to explain their humiliating defeat, agree. They return to the Third Prince with the fabricated story of the King's betrayal.)
THIRD PRINCE ZHAO HENG (Later, in his private chambers, hearing the report)
(His face contorted with fury)
My own brother! He used me as bait! He fears my strength! Very well, Zhao Rui. If you see me as an enemy, then an enemy I shall be!
(The Third Prince, driven by fear and wounded pride, begins to turn against his cruel older brother, creating a massive, destabilizing rift in the Crown's military and political structure—exactly what Zhao Yun and Xi Shi needed.)
(END OF ACT XII)

ACT XIII: THE PERILOUS STRATEGY
SCENE 35: THE COUNCIL OF WAR
SETTING: The most secure, underground vault beneath Second Prince ZHAO Yun's compound. The room is protected by the Prince's three elite guards: Su Ming (Dual Swords), Lian Hua (Whip), and Chen Guang (Shield & Staff).
AT RISE: The entire alliance is present: Zhao Yun and his Advisor Liu (recently rescued from the Censorate, looking frail but determined), Master Han Tao, and the Seven Bonds. A massive, detailed map of the Imperial Palace is spread across the table.
HAN TAO (The Master, pointing to the King's Throne Room)
The moment for subtlety is over. King Zhao Rui has accelerated his tyranny, and he will soon discover the treachery of his brother, Zhao Heng. The window for our attack is exactly one week.
XI SHI (The Strategist, taking the lead, her confidence absolute)
The plan is called "The Trident Strike." We hit the three centers of the King's power simultaneously, ensuring he has no reliable command structure to rally:
1. The Military Pillar: Grand Marshal Guo.
2. The Financial Pillar: Minister Wang and the Imperial Treasury.
3. The Symbol of Authority: The King's personal guard.
ADVISOR LIU (Weak but insightful)
The greatest danger is the Imperial Army's loyalty. If they see a simple murder, they will crush the rebellion. Prince Zhao Yun must be seen seizing the administrative heart of the kingdom while the King is incapacitated.
ZHAO YUN
I will lead the political and administrative takeover. I will take the Great Seal Chamber and issue decrees validating the rebellion, clearing the name of General Wei Jian.
LING XUAN
(Stepping forward, sword drawn)
The martial strike is ours. But who takes the greatest risk?
SCENE 36: THE TRIDENT STRIKE DETAIL
SETTING: The war council continues, detailing the high-risk assignments.
XI SHI
The assignments are based on specialized skill and maximum diversion:
• Financial Pillar (Diversion): Jiang Po (Intelligence) and Mu Feng (Jade Fan). They will use the Minister's own ledgers to infiltrate and disable the Imperial Treasury's defense system, creating a financial panic to pull away the city garrison.
• Military Pillar (Isolation): Mei Lin (Sword Addict) and Jun Li (Archery/Sensing). Jun Li will use a precise, long-range archery attack to isolate Grand Marshal Guo during a military parade. Mei Lin will use her speed to ensure Guo is captured, preventing him from issuing counter-orders. This will stall the entire Imperial Army.
• Symbol of Authority (Direct Strike): Ling Xuan, Han Tao, and Second Prince's Guards (Su Ming, Lian Hua, Chen Guang). This team will breach the inner palace. Han Tao will secure the rear; the Prince's guards will secure the Great Seal. Ling Xuan has the most perilous mission.
LING XUAN
(Her eyes meeting Jun Li's across the table, both accepting the immense risk)
I will go to the Throne Room. I will confront the King and his remaining loyal guard, Feng Lie (if he's recovered) and the assassin, Xue Ying. I will hold the attention of the ultimate power while the Prince secures the kingdom.
HAN TAO
The Throne Room will be a death trap. But your martial skill and your personal cause are the only things that will convince the remaining loyalists that the King's fall is just. You are the heart of the rebellion.
XI SHI
(Presenting a small, explosive device)
This is a single-use signaling flare. When the King is defeated, use this. It is the signal for Zhao Yun to seize the Great Seal and for the entire kingdom to know: The Rebellion Just Begun has succeeded.
SCENE 37: THE FAREWELLS
SETTING: The courtyard of the Prince's compound, late night.
AT RISE: The Seven Bonds share quiet farewells, fully aware that this is their last night together as they are.
XI SHI (Kissing Jiang Po)
Don't worry about my stealth mission. You worry about remembering the King's final cipher codes. If you die, I'll never forgive your poor martial arts.
JIANG PO
(Grinning)
I promise to be hilarious and alive when you return.
MEI LIN (Tightly embracing Mu Feng)
I will move so fast, my sword will be a blur. I will see you when the King's Marshal is tied up!
MU FENG
Be safe, my sword addict.
JUN LI (Holding Ling Xuan tightly)
My spiritual sensing will guide my arrows to protect you, even if the distance is impossible. I will track your qi until the moment that flare ignites. Be the sword of truth.
LING XUAN
(Drawing her father's sword, a final, clear-eyed look of resolve)
I carry my father's honor and our future. I will not fail.
(The final plan is in place. The teams disperse into the night, beginning the perilous journey that will either crown a new emperor or lead them all to the executioner's block.)
(END OF ACT XIII)

ACT XIV: THE REBELLION ERUPTS
SCENE 38: THE FINANCIAL PANIC
SETTING: The bustling, frantic Imperial Treasury building. Morning.
AT RISE: JIANG Po (Intelligence) and MU Feng (Jade Fan) are inside the heavily fortified structure, disguised as high-level financial auditors. Jiang Po, leveraging the embezzlement ledgers they previously stole, has planted data that suggests the Treasury is bankrupt.
JIANG PO (To the panicked Treasury guards and officials, with an air of superior knowledge)
I told you! The Betrayer of the North was a myth! The real truth is that Minister Wang (Revenue) and Grand Marshal Guo have hollowed out the Treasury! The vaults are empty! The King has been funding his tyranny with phantom gold!
(The false intelligence, combined with the earlier fires, triggers a massive panic. Treasury guards abandon their posts to protect their own families' savings. Mu Feng uses his Jade Fan to quietly and quickly disable the main communication line, ensuring the panic cannot be contained by the palace.)
MU FENG
(To Jiang Po, a touch of genuine excitement)
The diversion is working! The King's purse is paralyzed! Now for the Military Pillar!
SCENE 39: THE ARROW OF ISOLATION
SETTING: A ceremonial parade ground near the Grand Marshal's barracks. Mid-morning.
AT RISE: Grand Marshal GUO is reviewing troops, desperate to show stability. He is massive, arrogant, and surrounded by his personal retinue. Hidden on a distant clock tower, JUN Li (Archer/Sensing) is poised, bow drawn. Beside him, MEI Lin (Sword Addict) crouches, rapier ready.
JUN LI
(His Spiritual Sensing is at its maximum, ignoring the distance, focused on the life-force of the Marshal)
He is perfectly framed. The shot must be non-lethal, but incapacitating. It must prevent him from issuing orders.
(Jun Li releases the arrow. It is a legendary, impossible shot—flying hundreds of yards, bypassing flags, banners, and guards, and striking the Grand Marshal's shoulder, shattering the bone and making his sword arm useless. Chaos erupts in the parade ground.)
MEI LIN
(Grinning, launching herself from the clock tower with expert Lightness Skill)
My turn!
(Mei Lin descends like a hawk, using her speed to move through the panicked troops. She reaches the Marshal and, before the remaining guards can react, disarms him, binds him, and drags him into a pre-arranged tunnel, effectively decapitating the Imperial Army's command structure.)
SCENE 40: THE CONFRONTATION IN THE THRONE ROOM
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue. King ZHAO Rui sits alone on the Dragon Throne, informed of the chaos but unaware of its source. His only protection is his two guards: FENG Lie (Iron Palm), recently recovered, and XUE Ying (Assassin), his hand still bandaged.
AT RISE: The inner doors burst open. LING Xuan, clad in dark, light armor, stands ready. Behind her, Master HAN TAO and Prince Zhao Yun's guards (Su Ming, Lian Hua, Chen Guang) secure the exits.
KING ZHAO RUI
(A cold, terrible calm)
The General's little girl. You have caused me considerable trouble. I should have executed you alongside your traitor father.
LING XUAN
My father was a patriot! The treason was yours! I am here to execute the truth! Zhao Rui, your time is over!
FENG LIE (Roaring, launching a massive, desperate Iron Palm strike)
You die for the King!
(Ling Xuan ignores the brute. She dances around his predictable force, allowing Master Han Tao to subtly engage Feng Lie, using a draining, internal technique.)
XUE YING (The Assassin, emerging from the shadows)
You beat me once. You will not do so again!
(The true duel begins. Ling Xuan confronts the assassin, her father's sword a beacon of righteous speed against the shadow's malice. She uses her fluid style to draw Xue Ying toward the center of the hall, away from the King.)
MASTER HAN TAO (To Ling Xuan, while fighting Feng Lie)
Now, Xuan! The center!
(Ling Xuan executes a devastating, planned maneuver, using her Internal Qi to shatter the marble floor beneath Xue Ying. The assassin is thrown off balance, and Ling Xuan, seeing the perfect opening, delivers a precise, disabling strike to his chest, ending the King's most lethal defense.)
KING ZHAO RUI
(Leaping from the throne, pure desperation in his eyes)
You cannot touch me! I am the Emperor!
(Ling Xuan ignores him. She pulls the signaling flare from her pouch and ignites it. A brilliant white light streaks toward the highest peak of the palace.)
SCENE 41: THE SEIZURE OF THE SEAL
SETTING: The Great Seal Chamber, adjacent to the Throne Room.
AT RISE: The flare explodes over the sky. SECOND PRINCE ZHAO YUN, escorted by Advisor LIU and his guards, enters the Chamber.
ZHAO YUN
(Seizing the immense, carved Imperial Seal)
The moment is here. The rebellion has secured the throne. Advisor Liu, issue the immediate decree: General Wei Jian is exonerated! The former King, Zhao Rui, is to be stripped of his title and arrested for treason against the people!
(Zhao Yun, using the Seal and the legitimacy of the General's name, officially takes control of the kingdom, legitimizing the coup at the administrative heart.)
(END OF ACT XIV)

ACT XV: THE NEW DAWN
SCENE 42: THE KING'S LAST STAND
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue, moments after the white flare ignites. The atmosphere is one of contained chaos. Master Han Tao has neutralized the exhausted Feng Lie (Iron Palm). Xue Ying (Assassin) is disabled.
AT RISE: King ZHAO Rui (The Former Crown Prince) stands utterly alone. He stares at the victorious LING Xuan (The Heroine), his face a mask of disbelief, rage, and sudden, cold fear.
KING ZHAO RUI
(His voice hoarse)
You have doomed this kingdom to chaos! You think that peasant rabble will follow a gentle pretender and a vengeful daughter? Power is taken with the fist, not with righteous tears!
LING XUAN
(Her sword held steady, pointing at him)
My father's honor was not built on lies. Your power crumbled because it was built on fear and the betrayal of good men. You are stripped of your title and your protection. Surrender, Zhao Rui.
(Zhao Rui, rather than surrender, lunges with a desperate, wild, final strike, attempting to seize Ling Xuan's sword. She meets his rage with the disciplined precision of her training.)
LING XUAN
(Executing the final, perfect counter-strike taught by her Master)
You murdered my father for your greed!
(The strike is clean, disabling, and non-lethal, fulfilling Han Tao's wish to clear the General's name without resorting to assassination. King Zhao Rui collapses, his reign officially ended not by brute force, but by the weight of his own treachery.)
SCENE 43: THE CLEARED NAME
SETTING: The steps of the Imperial Palace. Hours later. Thousands of citizens and assembled officials, loyalists, and rebels fill the square.
AT RISE: Second Prince ZHAO Yun, wearing simple, unadorned robes, stands on the platform, holding the Imperial Seal. Advisor LIU reads the first decree of the new reign.
ADVISOR LIU
(His voice booming across the square)
By the authority of the New Emperor, ZHAO Yun, let this be known! General WEI Jian was a loyal servant and patriot! The charges of treason were fabricated lies orchestrated by the former Crown Prince and his corrupt officials! The General's honor is restored, his service is canonized, and his name will stand for true virtue!
(A massive, heartfelt roar erupts from the crowd—a wave of relief and justice washing over the capital. Ling Xuan stands beside the platform, watching the declaration. Jun Li steps to her side, his hand finding hers.)
JUN LI
(Quietly)
The long shot landed true, my love. Your father's name is clean.
(Nearby, the rest of the Seven Bonds—Xi Shi and Jiang Po, Mei Lin and Mu Feng—share smiles, a mixture of exhaustion and exhilaration at the successful completion of the perilous plan.)
SCENE 44: THE NEW DAWN
SETTING: The Imperial Hall of Virtue. Days later. Emperor ZHAO Yun is formally receiving the rebellion's heroes.
AT RISE: ZHAO YUN sits upon the throne, a picture of strategic wisdom and kind authority.
EMPEROR ZHAO YUN
(Addressing the Seven Bonds)
The Crown owes you its life and its legitimacy. The political structure is being purged, Minister Wang, Censor Zhou, and the two princes' guards have been arrested. Your actions forged this peace. Master Han Tao, you are offered the post of Grand Imperial Advisor.
HAN TAO
(Bowing)
Your Majesty, my duty to the Crown is done. I shall return to the Groves. I will be your shield outside the walls.
EMPEROR ZHAO YUN
(Turning to Ling Xuan)
And you, General's Daughter. Your father's rank and estate are restored. What is your wish?
LING XUAN
(Bowing, a look of profound peace on her face)
I seek no title, Your Majesty. My debt of honor is repaid. My wish is to travel the world with Jun Li and the Seven Bonds, using our skills to enforce the justice the throne cannot reach. We will be your unseen protectors against the shadows that remain.
EMPEROR ZHAO YUN
(Smiling, accepting the answer)
Go then, Soaring Jade. Be the conscience of the martial world.
(The novel concludes as Ling Xuan and Jun Li walk away from the palace toward the vast, unknown horizon. Their personal revenge has culminated in a political revolution, and their rebellion has secured the foundation for a just kingdom—a rebellion that has, indeed, Just Begun.)
(THE END)
